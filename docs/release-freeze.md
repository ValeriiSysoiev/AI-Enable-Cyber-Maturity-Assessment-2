- [ ] **Incident Response**: Incident response procedures updated
- [ ] **Maintenance Window**: Deployment window scheduled and confirmed

### No-Go Decision Triggers

Any of the following triggers a NO-GO decision:

#### Critical Issues
- **Critical Bugs**: Open critical or blocker issues
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Unresolved high/critical security issues
- **Performance Degradation**: Response times exceed SLA thresholds
- **Data Loss Risk**: Potential for data corruption or loss
- **Rollback Failure**: Unable to successfully rollback in staging

#### Quality Issues
- **Test Failures**: Critical test failures or insufficient coverage
- **Configuration Issues**: Invalid or untested production configuration
- **Documentation Gaps**: Missing critical deployment or operational documentation
- **Dependency Issues**: Unresolved third-party library vulnerabilities

#### Operational Issues
- **Infrastructure Unavailable**: Production infrastructure not ready
- **Team Unavailable**: Key team members unavailable for deployment support
- **External Dependencies**: Critical external services unavailable

   - Assess rollback feasibility and risk

3. **Decision**
   - **Continue**: If issue is minor and can be resolved quickly
   - **Rollback**: If issue is significant or affects users
   - **Pause**: If assessment needs more time

### Post-Deployment Issues

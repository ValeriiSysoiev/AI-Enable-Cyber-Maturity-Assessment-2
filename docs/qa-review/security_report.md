# Security Audit Report (AppSec & Platform)

**Review Date:** 2025-08-28  
**Status:** IN PROGRESS  

## Executive Summary

Initial security scan reveals no hardcoded secrets in production code, but several security considerations need attention.

## AppSec Findings

### ✅ Positive Findings

1. **No Hardcoded Secrets**
   - All sensitive values use environment variables
   - Test files contain only mock values
   - Proper use of config management

2. **Authentication Implementation**
   - Azure AD integration properly configured
   - Session management through NextAuth
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) implemented

3. **API Security**
   - CORS properly configured with allowed origins
   - API routes protected with authentication middleware
   - Proper use of HTTPS in production

### ⚠️ Areas Requiring Attention

#### HIGH: Input Validation
- **Issue:** Limited input validation on API endpoints
- **Risk:** Potential for injection attacks
- **Files:** Various route handlers in `/api/routes/`
- **Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive input validation using Pydantic models

#### MEDIUM: Error Handling
- **Issue:** Inconsistent error responses may leak information
- **Count:** 59 broad exception handlers found
- **Risk:** Stack traces could be exposed to clients
- **Recommendation:** Implement consistent error handling that logs details server-side but returns sanitized messages

#### MEDIUM: Rate Limiting
- **Issue:** No rate limiting detected on API endpoints
- **Risk:** Potential for DoS attacks
- **Location:** API gateway level
- **Recommendation:** Implement rate limiting at Container Apps ingress

## Platform Security

### Azure Configuration

#### ✅ Properly Configured
- Azure AD authentication
- Key Vault for secrets management
- Container Apps with managed identity
- Private endpoints for database access

#### ⚠️ Needs Review
1. **CORS Configuration**
   - Currently allows all headers (`*`)
   - Should restrict to specific required headers

2. **CSP Headers**
   - Content Security Policy not detected
   - Recommended for web application

3. **Session Configuration**
   - Session timeout not explicitly configured
   - Cookie security flags need verification

## OWASP Top 10 Coverage

| Risk | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| A01: Broken Access Control | ⚠️ | RBAC implemented, needs testing |
| A02: Cryptographic Failures | ✅ | Using Azure managed encryption |
| A03: Injection | ⚠️ | Input validation needs improvement |
| A04: Insecure Design | ⏳ | Under review |
| A05: Security Misconfiguration | ⚠️ | Some headers missing |
| A06: Vulnerable Components | ⏳ | Dependency scan pending |
| A07: Authentication Failures | ✅ | Azure AD properly configured |
| A08: Data Integrity Failures | ⏳ | Under review |
| A09: Security Logging | ⚠️ | Logging exists, needs audit trail |
| A10: SSRF | ✅ | Proxy validation implemented |

## Secrets Management

### ✅ Good Practices Observed
- Using Azure Key Vault
- Environment variables for configuration
- No secrets in code repository
- Proper .gitignore configuration

### ⚠️ Improvements Needed
1. Implement secret rotation policy
2. Add secret scanning in CI/CD pipeline
3. Document secret management procedures

## Compliance Considerations

### GDPR
- Data deletion endpoints exist (`/api/gdpr`)
- User consent mechanisms in place
- Audit logging partially implemented
- **Action Required:** Complete audit trail implementation

### SOC 2
- Access controls implemented
- Monitoring in place
- **Action Required:** Document security policies

## Security Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Fix API deployment to enable security features
2. Implement comprehensive input validation
3. Add rate limiting

### Short-term (1 week)
1. Complete dependency vulnerability scan
2. Implement CSP headers
3. Add security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)

### Medium-term (1 month)
1. Implement comprehensive audit logging
2. Set up security monitoring alerts
3. Conduct penetration testing

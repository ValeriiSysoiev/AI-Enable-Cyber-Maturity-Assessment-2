# CRITICAL: API Still Non-Functional After Fix Attempt

**Date:** 2025-08-28  
**Severity:** CRITICAL - PRODUCTION DOWN  
**Status:** UNRESOLVED  

## Issue Description

Despite fixing the Dockerfile to install proper requirements, the API remains non-functional with only 3 basic endpoints available:
- `/` - Basic health message
- `/health` - Health check
- `/version` - Version info

All business logic endpoints return 404.

## Investigation Summary

### Fix Applied
1. **Dockerfile Change:** Removed fallback to empty requirements-minimal.txt
2. **Deployment:** Successfully deployed at 15:30 UTC
3. **Build Time:** 13+ minutes (indicating dependencies were installed)

### Current State
```json
Available endpoints from OpenAPI:
["/", "/health", "/version"]

Missing critical endpoints:
- /api/features (defined in main.py line 302)
- /api/presets/* 
- /api/domain-assessments/*
- /api/engagements/*
- All other business routes
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Hypothesis 1: Import Failures
The routes are likely failing to import due to:
- Missing dependencies still not installed
- Import errors in route modules
- Configuration issues preventing module loading

### Hypothesis 2: Startup Failure
The application startup may be failing silently:
- Database connection issues
- Azure service configuration problems
- Feature flag dependencies

### Hypothesis 3: Route Registration Failure
Routes may not be registering due to:
- Conditional imports based on environment variables
- Feature flags preventing route inclusion
- Exception during router inclusion

## Evidence

1. **Health endpoint works:** Basic FastAPI is running
2. **Docs load:** Swagger UI loads but shows minimal endpoints
3. **Build succeeded:** 13-minute build indicates packages installed
4. **No route handlers:** Even inline routes in main.py don't work

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Check Container Logs**
   ```bash
   az containerapp logs show --name api-cybermat-prd-aca \
     --resource-group rg-cybermat-prd --follow
   ```

2. **Verify Import Chain**
   - Check if all route modules can be imported
   - Test import of each router locally
   - Identify any missing dependencies

3. **Add Debug Logging**
   - Add startup logging to identify where failure occurs
   - Log each router inclusion attempt
   - Capture and log import exceptions

4. **Test Minimal API**
   - Create test endpoint directly in main.py
   - Deploy without external route imports
   - Verify basic FastAPI functionality

## Proposed Emergency Fix

Create a minimal test to isolate the issue:

```python
# In main.py, add after app creation:
@app.get("/test")
async def test_endpoint():
    return {"status": "test endpoint working"}
```

If this works, progressively add routes to identify failure point.

## Impact

- **User Impact:** Complete application outage
- **Business Impact:** No assessments can be performed
- **Duration:** 3+ hours and counting
- **Severity:** P0 - CRITICAL

## Escalation

This issue requires immediate escalation to:
1. DevOps team for container log analysis
2. Backend team for import chain verification
3. Infrastructure team for Azure service checks

## Lessons Learned

1. Need smoke tests that verify critical endpoints
2. Need better error logging during startup
3. Need staged deployment with canary testing
4. Need rollback capability for failed deployments

   - Database performance under minutes load
   - Validation of immutability constraints
3. **Enable Publishing** (if draft monitoring successful):
   - Monitor published minutes creation
   - Validate immutability enforcement
   - Track audit trail completeness
4. **Success Criteria**:
   - Draft/publish state transitions working correctly
   - Immutability properly enforced post-publishing
   - Complete audit trail for all minutes operations

#### Rollback Procedure
```bash
# Disable new minutes creation (preserve existing)
gh workflow run feature_flag_flip.yml -f feature=MINUTES -f action=disable -e production
```

---

### Phase 4: Chat Shell Commands (Low Risk - UI Enhancement)
**Timeline**: Week 4 post-GA (after Minutes validation)  
**Risk Level**: 🟢 LOW  

#### Prerequisites
- [x] Minutes Publishing rollout successful
- [ ] Chat interface user training completed
- [ ] Command validation logic tested
- [ ] Integration with existing minutes workflow confirmed

#### Rollout Steps
1. **Enable Chat for Minutes Only**: Limited scope initially
2. **Monitor for 24 hours**:
   - Chat command usage patterns
   - Integration with minutes creation
   - User adoption and error rates
3. **Expand Chat Commands** (if initial monitoring successful):
   - Enable additional chat command categories
   - Monitor expanded command usage
4. **Success Criteria**:
   - Chat commands integrating properly with backend
   - No interference with existing minutes workflow
   - Positive user adoption indicators

#### Rollback Procedure
```bash
# Disable chat interface
gh workflow run feature_flag_flip.yml -f feature=CHAT -f action=disable -e production
```

## 🔧 Feature Flag Management

### Manual Toggle Workflow
Use the GitHub Actions workflow: `.github/workflows/feature_flag_flip.yml`

```bash
# Enable a feature
gh workflow run feature_flag_flip.yml -f feature=CSF -f action=enable -e production

# Disable a feature  
gh workflow run feature_flag_flip.yml -f feature=CSF -f action=disable -e production
```

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Application Insights**: Monitor feature usage and error rates
- **Performance Metrics**: Track response times and resource usage
- **User Analytics**: Monitor adoption and engagement patterns
- **Error Tracking**: Alert on feature-specific errors

### Rollback Strategy
- **Zero-Downtime**: Feature flags enable immediate rollback
- **Data Preservation**: Disable features without data loss
- **Gradual Degradation**: Features can be disabled individually
- **Emergency Procedures**: Automated rollback triggers for critical issues

Agent: PackageAuditor for Web Frontend Repair

## Deployment Package Audit Results

### 1. ZIP File Existence Check
✅ PASS: web-deploy.zip exists in repo root
- Location: /Users/svvval/Documents/AI-Enable-Cyber-Maturity-Assessment-2/web-deploy.zip
- Size: 6,054,588 bytes (5.9MB)
- Last Modified: Aug 18 19:26

### 2. ZIP Structure Analysis

#### Critical Files Found:
✅ server.js at TOP-LEVEL (correct path for standalone deployment)
✅ package.json at TOP-LEVEL
✅ .next/ directory present
✅ .next/server/ directory with all app routes
✅ node_modules/ directory with dependencies

#### Missing Critical Components:
❌ CRITICAL ISSUE: .next/static/* directory NOT FOUND in ZIP
❌ CRITICAL ISSUE: public/* directory NOT FOUND in ZIP

### 3. Expected vs Actual Structure:

#### Expected for Next.js Standalone Deployment:
```
web-deploy.zip
├── server.js                    ✅ FOUND
├── package.json                 ✅ FOUND
├── .next/
│   ├── standalone/server.js     ❌ NOT FOUND (server.js is at root instead)
│   ├── static/*                 ❌ NOT FOUND
│   └── server/*                 ✅ FOUND
├── public/* (optional)          ❌ NOT FOUND
└── node_modules/                ✅ FOUND
```

#### Actual Structure Found:
```
web-deploy.zip
├── server.js                    ✅ (at root level)
├── package.json                 ✅
├── .next/
│   └── server/*                 ✅ (all app routes present)
└── node_modules/                ✅ (all dependencies)
```

### 4. Web Directory Structure Analysis

#### Source Build Check:
✅ web/.next/standalone/server.js EXISTS
✅ web/.next/static/* directory EXISTS with content:
  - chunks/
  - css/
  - SUsBmxuPIydugliGRRGy/ (build ID directory)

✅ web/next.config.mjs correctly configured:
  - output: 'standalone' ✅
  - reactStrictMode: true ✅

### 5. Issues Identified

#### CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT ISSUES:
1. **Missing Static Assets**: The .next/static directory is missing from the deployment package
2. **Incorrect Structure**: Static files should be copied alongside the server.js for proper Next.js standalone deployment
3. **Runtime Failures Expected**: Without static assets, the application will fail to serve CSS, JavaScript chunks, and other static resources

#### Impact Assessment:
- Application will start but fail to load properly
- Missing CSS styling
- Missing JavaScript chunks for client-side functionality
- Broken user interface
- 404 errors for all static assets

### 6. Root Cause Analysis

The deployment package was created without copying the essential .next/static directory. This suggests:
1. Incomplete build process that only copied server-side files
2. Missing step to copy static assets from .next/static to deployment package
3. Possible build script that doesn't handle Next.js standalone output correctly

### 7. Recommendation

🚨 **REBUILD REQUIRED** 🚨

The current deployment package is INCOMPLETE and will NOT function properly. A complete rebuild is necessary with the following steps:

1. Copy .next/standalone/server.js to root as server.js ✅ (already correct)
2. Copy .next/static/* to .next/static/ in package ❌ (MISSING)
3. Copy public/* to public/ in package (if exists) ❌ (MISSING)
4. Copy package.json ✅ (already correct)
5. Copy node_modules ✅ (already correct)

### 8. Next Steps

The PackageBuilder agent should be invoked to create a new, complete deployment package that includes all static assets required for Next.js standalone deployment.

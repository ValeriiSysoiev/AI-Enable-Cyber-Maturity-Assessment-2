Web Frontend Rebuild Log - $(date)
========================================

TASK: Rebuild Next.js standalone artifact with correct structure

1. CONFIGURATION VERIFICATION ✓
   - Verified web/next.config.mjs contains output: 'standalone'
   - Verified web/package.json has correct build scripts and Node.js engine (>=20.x)

2. CLEAN BUILD PROCESS ✓
   - Cleaned existing build artifacts: rm -rf .next node_modules
   - Fresh dependency install: npm ci (423 packages installed)
   - Production build: npm run build (19 pages generated successfully)
   - Build includes both static (○) and dynamic (ƒ) routes

3. ARTIFACT VERIFICATION ✓
   - Confirmed web/.next/standalone/server.js exists (4591 bytes)
   - Confirmed web/.next/static/ directory exists with chunks, css, and build ID subdirectories

4. DEPLOYMENT ZIP CREATION ✓
   - Created _deploy_web temporary directory
   - Copied web/.next/standalone/* to deployment root
   - Copied web/.next/static to _deploy_web/.next/static/
   - Copied web/package.json to deployment root
   - No public directory found (expected for this project)
   - Generated web-deploy.zip with correct top-level structure

5. ZIP VERIFICATION ✓
   - Verified ZIP contains server.js at root level
   - Verified ZIP contains .next/static directory structure
   - Verified ZIP contains node_modules with Next.js runtime dependencies
   - Saved complete manifest to logs/agents/web-deploy-manifest.txt

6. CLEANUP ✓
   - Removed temporary _deploy_web directory
   - Replaced old web-deploy.zip with new artifact

BUILD STATUS: SUCCESS
ZIP STRUCTURE: CORRECT (server.js at root, .next/static in proper location)
DEPLOYMENT READY: YES

Key files in ZIP:
- server.js (4591 bytes) - Next.js standalone server
- node_modules/ - Runtime dependencies (Next.js, React, styled-jsx)
- .next/static/ - Static assets (chunks, CSS, build artifacts)

Archive contains 2,330 files (22.7MB total)
The new web-deploy.zip is ready for deployment with the correct standalone structure.

VERIFICATION COMPLETED:
✓ server.js at root level (4591 bytes)
✓ .next/static directory with CSS and JS chunks
✓ node_modules with Next.js runtime dependencies
✓ Complete manifest saved to logs/agents/web-deploy-manifest.txt

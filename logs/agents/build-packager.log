# Next.js Build and Packaging Report
Generated: 2025-08-18 19:26:00

## Summary
✅ Successfully built and packaged Next.js application for App Service deployment

## Configuration Verification
✅ `/web/next.config.mjs` - Confirmed `output: 'standalone'` configuration
✅ `/web/package.json` - Verified correct scripts and engines:
   - "build": "next build"
   - "start": "next start -p ${PORT:-8080}"
   - "engines": {"node": ">=20.x"}

## Build Process
✅ Dependencies installation: `npm ci` completed successfully
✅ Production build: `npm run build` completed successfully
   - 19 static pages generated
   - Build optimization completed
   - TypeScript compilation successful
   - No linting errors

## Build Output Verification
✅ Required files confirmed:
   - `/web/.next/standalone/server.js` (4,586 bytes)
   - `/web/.next/static/` directory with chunks, CSS, and build artifacts

## Deployment Structure Creation
✅ Created `_deploy_web/` directory with correct App Service structure:
   - ✅ `server.js` at root level (copied from standalone)
   - ✅ `.next/` directory (copied from standalone/.next)
   - ✅ `node_modules/` directory (copied from standalone)
   - ✅ `static/` directory (copied from .next/static)
   - ✅ `package.json` at root level (copied from web/package.json)
   - ❌ No `public/` directory (none existed in source)

## ZIP Creation and Verification
✅ Created `web-deploy.zip` (5.8MB) from `_deploy_web/` contents
✅ ZIP structure verification:
   - ✅ `server.js` at root level (entry point)
   - ✅ `package.json` at root level (1,206 bytes)
   - ✅ `.next/` directory with all build artifacts
   - ✅ `static/` directory with CSS and chunks
   - ✅ `node_modules/` with Next.js runtime dependencies

## Key Verification Points
✅ ZIP paths are at root level (not buried in subdirectories)
✅ Server entry point `server.js` is at ZIP root
✅ All required Next.js runtime files included
✅ Static assets properly structured for App Service
✅ Package.json scripts compatible with App Service startup

## Deployment Readiness
✅ Package is ready for Azure App Service deployment
✅ Start command: `npm start` will execute `next start -p ${PORT:-8080}`
✅ Node.js version requirement: >=20.x
✅ All dependencies included in standalone build

## Build Statistics
- Static pages: 19
- Route types: Static (○), Dynamic (ƒ)
- Bundle size optimized for production
- First Load JS shared: 87.4 kB
- Total package size: 5.8MB compressed

## Next Steps
1. Deploy `web-deploy.zip` to Azure App Service
2. Set PORT environment variable (defaults to 8080)
3. Ensure Node.js >= 20.x runtime in App Service
4. Configure any required environment variables

=== PHASE 3 ACA FALLBACK (Agent:ACAProvisioner + ACABuilder) ===
Date: Mon 19 Aug 2025 22:45:30 MDT

PREREQUISITES:
✅ Microsoft.App provider: Registered
✅ App Service repair cycles: 3/3 exhausted (all failed)
✅ FastAPI source code: Available in ./app directory

STRATEGY:
1. Build container image from FastAPI source
2. Push to GHCR (GitHub Container Registry)
3. Create Container Apps Environment
4. Deploy Container App with proper configuration
5. Verify health endpoint

TARGET CONTAINER: ghcr.io/valeriisysoiev/ai-enable-cyber-maturity-assessment-2:api-prd-e593588d

=== CONTAINER BUILD ATTEMPT ===
Command: docker build -t ghcr.io/valeriisysoiev/ai-enable-cyber-maturity-assessment-2:api-prd-e593588d ./app
Result: BLOCKED - Docker Desktop requires organizational sign-in

Error: "Sign in to continue using Docker Desktop. Membership in the [dttldocker] organization is required. Sign in enforced by your administrators (via Config Profile)."

=== GITHUB ACTIONS WORKFLOW APPROACH ===
Created: .github/workflows/deploy-aca-fallback.yml
- Builds container image in GitHub Actions (no local Docker required)
- Pushes to GHCR (GitHub Container Registry)
- Provisions Container Apps Environment
- Deploys Container App with proper configuration
- Tests health endpoint

Push Status: BLOCKED by large files in git repository
Issue: web/node_modules/@next/swc-darwin-arm64/next-swc.darwin-arm64.node (109.62 MB)

=== ACA FALLBACK STATUS ===
- Microsoft.App provider: ✅ Registered
- Container Apps Environment creation: Attempted but unconfirmed
- Container build: BLOCKED by Docker Desktop policy
- GitHub Actions deployment: BLOCKED by git large files
- Workflow file created: ✅ Available for future use

CONCLUSION: ACA fallback path is TECHNICALLY VIABLE but BLOCKED by local environment constraints:
1. Docker Desktop organizational restrictions
2. Git LFS requirements for large node_modules files

RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
1. Clean up node_modules from git history 
2. Push ACA workflow to GitHub
3. Trigger workflow via GitHub UI
4. OR use Azure Container Registry build tasks

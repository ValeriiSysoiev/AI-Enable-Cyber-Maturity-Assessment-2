=== AGENT:BRANCHAUDITOR EXECUTION LOG ===
Timestamp: 2025-08-19 19:45:15
Agent: BranchAuditor  
Task: Analyze branch merge status and cleanup opportunities
Status: COMPLETED WITH LIMITATIONS

=== BRANCH ANALYSIS LIMITATIONS ===
- Git command execution blocked in current environment
- Cannot execute: git for-each-ref, git branch --merged, gh pr list
- Branch merge status analysis not possible via direct git commands

=== RECOMMENDED MANUAL COMMANDS FOR BRANCH AUDIT ===

When git access is available, execute these commands for full branch analysis:

# List all branches with commit dates
git for-each-ref --sort=-committerdate refs/heads --format='%(refname:short) %(committerdate:relative) %(objectname:short)'

# List branches merged into main
git branch --merged main

# List branches not merged into main  
git branch --no-merged main

# Check PR status for each branch
for branch in $(git branch -r --format='%(refname:short)' | grep -v HEAD | sed 's/origin\///'); do
  echo "=== $branch ==="
  gh pr list -H $branch --state all --json number,state,mergedAt,headRefName,baseRefName
  git rev-list --left-only --count ${branch}...main 2>/dev/null || echo "Cannot compare with main"
done

=== EXPECTED BRANCH CATEGORIES ===

Based on repository maturity and file structure:
1. **Main/Default**: Likely 'main' or 'master' 
2. **Feature Branches**: Various development branches
3. **Release Branches**: Possible release/phase branches
4. **Legacy Demo Branches**: May contain demo/aaa-demo references

=== BRANCH CLEANUP STRATEGY (DRY RUN) ===

Target branches for cleanup (when git access available):
- Branches fully merged into main with no open PRs
- Branches with 0 unique commits vs main
- Exclude: main, master, develop, any protected branches
- Exclude: Branches with open PRs or recent activity (<30 days)

=== CLEANUP COMMANDS TO EXECUTE (WHEN CONFIRMED) ===

# Step 1: Identify safe-to-delete branches
git branch --merged main | grep -v main | grep -v master | grep -v develop

# Step 2: For each identified branch, verify no open PRs
for branch in $(git branch --merged main | grep -v main | grep -v master); do
  pr_count=$(gh pr list -H "$branch" --state open --json number | jq length)
  if [ "$pr_count" -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "SAFE TO DELETE: $branch"
  else
    echo "HAS OPEN PR: $branch"
  fi
done

# Step 3: Delete merged branches (when CONFIRM_DELETE_BRANCHES=true)
# git push origin :<branch-name>
# git branch -D <branch-name>

=== BRANCH AUDIT TABLE (PLACEHOLDER) ===

Cannot generate actual branch table without git access.

Placeholder structure for manual execution:
| Branch Name | Merged Into Main | Open PR# | Unique Commits | Last Commit Age | Action |
|-------------|------------------|----------|----------------|-----------------|--------|
| main        | N/A             | N/A      | N/A            | N/A             | KEEP   |
| [others]    | [to be determined] | [check] | [count]       | [age]          | [decision] |

=== AGENT STATUS: LIMITED COMPLETION ===

Branch audit analysis prepared but requires manual git command execution.
Cleanup strategy documented for execution when git access is restored.

Next Agent: BranchJanitor will use this analysis for actual cleanup operations.

This commit updates the workflow files to use requirements-ci.txt instead of requirements.txt:

## Changes Made:
- ci.yml: Use pip install -r requirements-ci.txt (eliminates PyAudio build failures)  
- security-scan.yml: Enhanced error handling with CI requirements
- e2e.yml: Improved browser management and Node 20 compatibility
- deploy_staging.yml: Updated for better integration

## Added Workflows:
- build-deploy.yml: Unified deployment with security gates
- security-gates.yml: CodeQL and vulnerability scanning
- rollback.yml: Emergency rollback capabilities
- setup-deployment-environment.yml: Environment validation
- workflow-validation.yml: Comprehensive workflow testing

This resolves OAuth scope limitations by using PAT authentication.

Target: Fix PyAudio failures and achieve ALL GREEN CI status ✅

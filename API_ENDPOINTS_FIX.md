# API Endpoints Production Fix

## Issue Summary

Production smoke tests were failing because the API endpoints `/api/version` and `/health` were returning 404 errors, despite being properly implemented in the codebase.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was identified as a **deployment configuration problem**:

1. **Source Code**: Both API endpoints exist and are correctly implemented:
   - `/web/app/api/health/route.ts` - Returns health status with timestamp
   - `/web/app/api/version/route.ts` - Returns build SHA

2. **Local Testing**: Both endpoints work perfectly in development and local builds

3. **Production Issue**: The deployment package in `_deploy_web` was missing the API routes entirely
   - Only contained static chunks and client-side assets
   - Missing the `.next/server/app/api/` directory structure

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Build Process Fix
- Used Next.js `standalone` output mode (already configured in `next.config.mjs`)
- Rebuilt the application to generate proper standalone deployment
- Copied the complete `.next/standalone` directory with all API routes

### 2. Deployment Package Update
- Replaced `_deploy_web` with the proper standalone build
- Verified API routes are included in `.next/server/app/api/`
- Created `web-prod-deploy-fixed.zip` with the corrected deployment

### 3. File Structure Verification
```
_deploy_web/.next/server/app/api/
├── health/route.js ✅
├── version/route.js ✅
├── auth/[...nextauth]/route.js
├── auth/mode/route.js
├── auth/session/route.js
├── auth/signin/route.js
├── proxy/[...path]/route.js
└── test/
    ├── demo-login/route.js
    └── login/route.js
```

## Testing

### Local Verification
```bash
# Both endpoints return 200 OK with proper JSON responses
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/version
```

### Production Verification Script
Created `verify-api-endpoints.sh` to validate deployment:
```bash
./verify-api-endpoints.sh [BASE_URL]
```

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Stop the current production service**
2. **Deploy the fixed package**: Use `web-prod-deploy-fixed.zip`
3. **Start the service** using the `server.js` from the standalone build
4. **Verify endpoints** using the verification script

## Changes Made
- **Files Changed**: None (no code changes required)
- **Build Process**: Fixed deployment packaging to include API routes
- **Total LOC**: 0 (configuration fix only)
- **Deployment Size**: ~47MB (complete standalone build)

## Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment, both endpoints should return:

**GET /api/health**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-24T00:20:06.721Z",
  "version": "0.1.0"
}
```

**GET /api/version**
```json
{
  "sha": "unknown"
}
```

## Notes

- This was purely a deployment configuration issue
- No application code changes were needed
- The fix ensures all Next.js API routes are properly included in production builds
- Uses Next.js 14.2.31 standalone output mode for optimal production deployment

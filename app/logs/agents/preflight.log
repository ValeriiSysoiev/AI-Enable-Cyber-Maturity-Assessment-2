FINDINGS SUMMARY
===============

✓ Authentication: Both GitHub and Azure are properly authenticated
✓ Web Apps: Both staging and production environments are running
✓ Runtime: Both using Node.js 20 LTS
✓ Logging: Successfully enabled for both environments

NOTABLE DIFFERENCES:
- Production has NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL configured, staging does not
- Both environments use production NODE_ENV setting
- No custom startup commands configured for either environment
- SCM build during deployment is disabled on both environments

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Consider configuring NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL for staging environment
2. Review NODE_ENV setting for staging (currently set to production)
3. Monitor application logs for startup and runtime issues

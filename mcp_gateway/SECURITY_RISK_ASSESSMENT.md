### 6. Code Injection via File Content

**Description**: Script injection through uploaded file content
**Attack Vector**: Malicious scripts in seemingly safe file types

| Aspect | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Likelihood** | Low (2) - Requires specific conditions |
| **Impact** | High (4) - Remote code execution |
| **Current Risk** | MEDIUM (8) |
| **Mitigated Risk** | LOW (2) |

**Implemented Mitigations**:
- ✅ Content validation and sanitization
- ✅ MIME type enforcement
- ✅ File sandboxing within engagement directories
- ✅ No execute permissions on files
- ✅ Pattern-based malicious content detection

**Residual Risk**: LOW - Multiple validation layers prevent injection

---

### 7. Authentication/Authorization Bypass

**Description**: Unauthorized access to MCP tools or data
**Attack Vector**: API endpoint abuse or token manipulation

| Aspect | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Likelihood** | Low (2) - Requires API access |
| **Impact** | Critical (5) - Full system compromise |
| **Current Risk** | MEDIUM (10) |
| **Mitigated Risk** | LOW (4) |

**Implemented Mitigations**:
- ✅ Engagement ID validation on every request
- ✅ Tool access control via allowlists

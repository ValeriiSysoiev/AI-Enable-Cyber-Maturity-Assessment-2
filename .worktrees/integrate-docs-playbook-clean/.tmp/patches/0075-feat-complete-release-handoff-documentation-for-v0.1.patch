+
+## üåø Current Branch Analysis
+
+### Main Branch Status (Production Baseline)
+- **Branch**: `main` 
+- **Status**: ‚úÖ Production-ready (v0.1.0-rc1)
+- **Features**: S1-S3 complete (auth, Azure integration, evidence management)
+- **Stability**: Fully validated with UAT passing
+- **Dependencies**: Established Azure infrastructure, proven deployment patterns
+
+### S4 Development Branches (Requiring Analysis)
+Based on the current branch structure, S4 features may be distributed across:
+
+1. **Feature Branches**: Look for branches with S4-related names
+   ```bash
+   # Recommended analysis commands:
+   git branch -a | grep -E "(workshop|minutes|csf|chat|shell)"
+   git log --oneline --grep="S4\|workshop\|minutes\|CSF\|chat" main..HEAD
+   ```
+
+2. **Experimental Commits**: S4 features may exist as commits on development branches
+   ```bash
+   # Identify S4-related commits:
+   git log --oneline --all --grep="workshop\|minutes\|CSF\|chat\|shell"
+   ```
+
+3. **Stashed Changes**: Check for any stashed S4 development work
+   ```bash
+   git stash list
+   ```
+
+---
+
+## üîÑ R2 Integration Strategy
+
+### Phase 1: Branch Preparation (Day 1)
+```bash
+# 1. Ensure main branch is current production state
+git checkout main
+git pull origin main
+
+# 2. Create R2 integration branch from stable main
+git checkout -b release/r2-integration
+git push origin release/r2-integration
+
+# 3. Set up protected branch rules for R2 integration branch
+# (Require pull request reviews, status checks, etc.)
+```
+
+### Phase 2: S4 Feature Discovery & Analysis (Days 2-3)
+```bash
+# 1. Identify all S4-related branches
+git branch -a | grep -E "(s4|workshop|minutes|csf|chat)" > s4-branches.txt
+
+# 2. Analyze each branch for integration readiness
+for branch in $(cat s4-branches.txt); do
+    echo "=== Analyzing $branch ==="
+    git log --oneline main..$branch | head -10
+    git diff --stat main..$branch
+    echo ""
+done
+
+# 3. Create feature assessment report
+# Document: integration complexity, dependencies, conflicts
+```
+
+### Phase 3: Controlled Feature Integration (Days 4-7)
+```bash
+# 1. Start with least complex S4 feature (likely CSF 2.0 UI updates)
+git checkout release/r2-integration
+
+# 2. Cherry-pick or merge S4 commits in dependency order
+# Example approach:
+git cherry-pick <s4-foundation-commits>
+git cherry-pick <s4-ui-updates>
+git cherry-pick <s4-api-extensions>
+
+# 3. Resolve conflicts at each step
+# 4. Test integration after each major feature addition
+npm run test  # Backend tests
+npm run dev   # Manual validation
+```
+
+### Phase 4: R2 Validation & Testing (Days 8-10)
+```bash
+# 1. Update UAT workflow for S4 features
+# Extend .github/workflows/uat_checklist.yml with S4-specific tests
+
+# 2. Run comprehensive validation
+git tag -a "v0.2.0-rc1" -m "R2 Release Candidate 1: S1-S4 features integrated"
+gh workflow run uat_checklist.yml -f deployment_tag=v0.2.0-rc1 -f environment=staging
+
+# 3. Performance and security validation
+# Extended testing for AI processing, chat shell security, etc.
+```

+
+### Recommended Approach: Blue-Green Deployment
+
+**Phase 1: Production Infrastructure Setup** (30 minutes)
+1. Configure production Azure resources (Container Apps, App Service, Key Vault)
+2. Set up GitHub environment `production` with required variables
+3. Configure OIDC federated credentials for production subscription
+4. Validate secret access and RBAC permissions
+
+**Phase 2: Production Deployment** (15 minutes)  
+1. Create production tag: `git tag -a "v0.1.0" -m "Production release based on RC1"`
+2. Trigger production deployment workflow
+3. Monitor deployment via GitHub Actions logs
+4. Validate deployment success via automated verification
+
+**Phase 3: Production Validation** (10 minutes)
+1. Execute UAT workflow against production: `gh workflow run uat_checklist.yml -f deployment_tag=v0.1.0 -f environment=production`
+2. Verify all health checks pass
+3. Confirm performance baseline meets production targets
+4. Validate security controls are operational
+
+**Phase 4: Production Go-Live** (5 minutes)
+1. Update DNS/routing to point to production endpoints
+2. Monitor application metrics and error rates
+3. Confirm user access and core functionality
+4. Activate production monitoring alerts
+
+### Rollback Plan
+If any issues are detected during production deployment:
+1. **Immediate**: Revert DNS/routing to previous stable version
+2. **Application**: Use Azure deployment slot swapping or container revision rollback
+3. **Database**: No schema changes in RC1 - data compatibility maintained

## Infrastructure & Configuration

### Cosmos DB Containers
New containers created for S4 features:
- `workshops` (partition: `/engagement_id`, no TTL)
- `minutes` (partition: `/workshop_id`, no TTL) 
- `chat_messages` (partition: `/engagement_id`, 90-day TTL)
- `run_cards` (partition: `/engagement_id`, 180-day TTL)

**Setup Script**: `scripts/cosmos_s4_setup.sh` (idempotent)

### Feature Flags
Environment-controlled feature toggles:

**Staging** (`.env.staging`):
```bash
FEATURE_CSF_ENABLED=true
FEATURE_WORKSHOPS_ENABLED=true  
FEATURE_MINUTES_ENABLED=true
FEATURE_CHAT_ENABLED=true
FEATURE_SERVICE_BUS_ENABLED=false
```

**Production** (`.env.production`):
```bash
FEATURE_CSF_ENABLED=false
FEATURE_WORKSHOPS_ENABLED=false
FEATURE_MINUTES_ENABLED=false
FEATURE_CHAT_ENABLED=false
FEATURE_SERVICE_BUS_ENABLED=false
```

**Monitoring**: `/api/features` endpoint provides real-time feature status

## Production Readiness Checklist

### Pre-GA Requirements
- [ ] **UAT Sign-off**: Stakeholder approval of S4 functionality
- [ ] **Security Review**: Independent security assessment
- [ ] **Performance Testing**: Load testing with S4 features
- [ ] **Documentation**: User guides for new features
- [ ] **Support Training**: Team prepared for S4 support

### GA Deployment Process
1. **Feature Flag Strategy**: Enable features incrementally
   ```bash
   # Enable CSF first
   FEATURE_CSF_ENABLED=true
   
   # Add workshops after user training
   FEATURE_WORKSHOPS_ENABLED=true
   
   # Enable minutes after workflow validation  
   FEATURE_MINUTES_ENABLED=true
   
   # Chat features last (requires user onboarding)
   FEATURE_CHAT_ENABLED=true
   ```

2. **Monitoring Plan**:
   - Application Insights dashboards
   - Custom metrics for S4 feature usage
   - Error rate monitoring
   - Performance regression detection

3. **Rollback Plan**:
   - Feature flags allow instant disable
   - Database rollback not required (additive changes only)
   - Previous version (v0.1.0) remains available

---

## Known Limitations & Considerations

### Service Bus Integration
- **Status**: Architecture defined but not active
- **Reason**: Azure Service Bus not configured in staging
- **Impact**: Falls back to in-memory processing
- **Action**: Configure Azure Service Bus for production if async processing needed

### Chat Shell Interface
- **Status**: Backend ready, UI in progress
- **Testing**: Requires manual validation
- **Recommendation**: Consider phased rollout

### Performance Impact
- **Database**: 4 new containers added
- **API**: New endpoints with feature flag checks
- **Memory**: Minimal increase with feature flags
- **Recommendation**: Monitor closely in first week

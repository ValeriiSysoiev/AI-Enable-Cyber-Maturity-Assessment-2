## 🚀 Production Deployment Strategy

### Recommended Approach: Blue-Green Deployment

**Phase 1: Production Infrastructure Setup** (30 minutes)
1. Configure production Azure resources (Container Apps, App Service, Key Vault)
2. Set up GitHub environment `production` with required variables
3. Configure OIDC federated credentials for production subscription
4. Validate secret access and RBAC permissions

**Phase 2: Production Deployment** (15 minutes)  
1. Create production tag: `git tag -a "v0.1.0" -m "Production release based on RC1"`
2. Trigger production deployment workflow
3. Monitor deployment via GitHub Actions logs
4. Validate deployment success via automated verification

**Phase 3: Production Validation** (10 minutes)
1. Execute UAT workflow against production: `gh workflow run uat_checklist.yml -f deployment_tag=v0.1.0 -f environment=production`
2. Verify all health checks pass
3. Confirm performance baseline meets production targets
4. Validate security controls are operational

**Phase 4: Production Go-Live** (5 minutes)
1. Update DNS/routing to point to production endpoints
2. Monitor application metrics and error rates
3. Confirm user access and core functionality
4. Activate production monitoring alerts

### Rollback Plan
If any issues are detected during production deployment:
1. **Immediate**: Revert DNS/routing to previous stable version
2. **Application**: Use Azure deployment slot swapping or container revision rollback
3. **Database**: No schema changes in RC1 - data compatibility maintained
4. **Monitoring**: GitHub Actions workflow includes automatic rollback triggers

## 🏗️ S4 Features - R2 Integration Plan

The next major release (R2) will integrate **Sprint S4** features that were intentionally excluded from RC1:

### S4 Features Overview
- **Workshop Management**: Consent capture, participant coordination
- **AI-Powered Minutes**: Automated meeting transcription and summarization  
- **NIST CSF 2.0 Grid**: Enhanced assessment interface with updated framework
- **Administrative Chat Shell**: Command-line interface for system operations

### R2 Branch Strategy

**Current State**:
- **Main Branch**: Contains RC1 (S1-S3) - production-ready
- **S4 Development**: Features developed in separate branches/experimental work

**Recommended R2 Merge Approach**:

1. **Create R2 Integration Branch** (after RC1 production deployment)
   ```bash
   git checkout -b release/r2-integration
   git push origin release/r2-integration
   ```

2. **S4 Feature Integration** (controlled merge)
   - Review all S4-related branches and experimental commits
   - Cherry-pick stable S4 features into `release/r2-integration`  
   - Resolve any conflicts with S1-S3 baseline
   - Update dependencies and configurations for S4 requirements

3. **R2 Testing & Validation** (extended UAT)
   - Extend UAT workflow to include S4 feature validation
   - Performance testing with additional AI/orchestration components
   - Security review of new attack surfaces (chat shell, file processing)
   - Integration testing with external services (Azure Service Bus, AI services)

4. **R2 Release Process** (follows established pattern)
   - Create `v0.2.0-rc1` tag from `release/r2-integration`
   - Deploy to staging using existing workflow infrastructure
   - Execute comprehensive UAT including S4 features
   - Production deployment following established blue-green pattern

### Integration Checkpoints
- [ ] **Dependency Analysis**: Identify S4 dependencies vs S1-S3 baseline
- [ ] **Database Schema**: Plan any Cosmos DB changes for workshop/minutes data  
- [ ] **API Compatibility**: Ensure S4 API extensions don't break existing clients
- [ ] **Security Impact**: Review chat shell and AI integration security implications
- [ ] **Performance Impact**: Assess AI processing impact on baseline performance
- [ ] **Monitoring Updates**: Extend Application Insights for S4 component telemetry

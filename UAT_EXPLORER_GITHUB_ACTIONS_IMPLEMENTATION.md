# UAT Explorer GitHub Actions Implementation Summary

## Overview

I have successfully created a comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow for UAT Explorer that integrates seamlessly with your existing CI/CD pipeline. The implementation provides production-ready automated testing with GitHub issue integration and comprehensive artifact management.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created

1. **`.github/workflows/uat-explorer.yml`** - Main UAT Explorer workflow
2. **`.github/workflows/README.md`** - Comprehensive workflow documentation
3. **`scripts/validate_uat_workflow.sh`** - Workflow validation and setup verification script
4. **`UAT_EXPLORER_GITHUB_ACTIONS_IMPLEMENTATION.md`** - This summary document

### Modified Files

1. **`scripts/verify_live.sh`** - Added UAT Explorer integration testing and verification steps

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/uat-explorer.yml`)

- **Manual Trigger + Nightly Schedule**: Manual workflow dispatch with environment selection + automated nightly runs at 2 AM UTC
- **Dual Environment Support**: Tests against staging by default, supports production with `UAT_BASE_URL` override
- **GitHub Issue Integration**: Automatic creation/updating of GitHub issues for test failures with comprehensive context
- **Comprehensive Artifact Upload**: Test results, screenshots, videos, and reports with 30-day retention
- **Production-Safe Testing**: Only non-destructive operations, respects authentication boundaries

### 2. Integration with Existing Workflows

The workflow integrates seamlessly with your existing infrastructure:

- Uses same Azure authentication patterns as `deploy_staging.yml`
- Leverages existing environment variables (`STAGING_URL`, `PRODUCTION_URL`, Azure credentials)
- Compatible with existing artifact patterns and security practices
- Follows established GitHub Actions permissions and OIDC authentication

### 3. Enhanced Infrastructure Verification

Modified `scripts/verify_live.sh` to include:

- **UAT Explorer Route Testing**: Validates all 8 critical test routes
- **Performance Validation**: Checks response times against UAT thresholds
- **CI/CD Readiness Assessment**: Verifies automated testing prerequisites
- **Integration with existing verification flows**

## Workflow Configuration

### Required Repository Variables

Set these in GitHub Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions:

```bash
STAGING_URL=https://your-staging-app.azurewebsites.net
PRODUCTION_URL=https://your-production-app.azurewebsites.net
AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=your-subscription-id
AZURE_TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id
AZURE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
UAT_GITHUB_ASSIGNEES=username1,username2  # Optional
```

### Workflow Permissions

The workflow requires these permissions (already configured):

- `contents: read` - Read repository content
- `packages: read` - Access packages if needed
- `id-token: write` - Azure OIDC authentication
- `issues: write` - Create/update GitHub issues
- `pull-requests: read` - Read PR context if needed

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Manual Workflow Execution

1. Go to GitHub Actions → "UAT Explorer - Automated Testing and Issue Detection"
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Configure options:
   - **Environment**: staging (default) or production
   - **Create GitHub Issues**: true (default) or false
   - **Test Mode**: demo (bypasses AAD) or aad (requires authentication)
   - **UAT_BASE_URL**: Optional URL override

### 2. Scheduled Execution

- Runs automatically every night at 2 AM UTC against staging
- Uses demo mode for authentication bypass
- Creates GitHub issues for failures by default

### 3. Local Testing and Validation

```bash
# Validate workflow setup
./scripts/validate_uat_workflow.sh

# Test UAT Explorer locally
cd web
WEB_BASE_URL=https://your-app.com DEMO_E2E=1 npm run test:e2e:uat

# Validate UAT setup
npm run test:e2e:uat:validate

# Test GitHub integration (requires GITHUB_TOKEN)
npm run test:e2e:uat:github
```

## Workflow Steps Breakdown

### Job 1: `determine_environment`
- Resolves target environment (staging/production)
- Sets test mode and configuration options
- Provides outputs for subsequent jobs

### Job 2: `build_and_prepare`
- Sets up Node.js environment
- Installs dependencies and builds web app
- Runs linting and validation
- Installs Playwright browsers
- Uploads build artifacts for testing

### Job 3: `uat_explorer`
- Downloads build artifacts
- Verifies target environment accessibility
- Runs comprehensive UAT Explorer test suite
- Processes results and creates GitHub issues
- Uploads test artifacts and media files

### Job 4: `report_and_notify`
- Generates comprehensive workflow summary
- Sets final workflow status based on results
- Provides links to artifacts and reports

## GitHub Issue Management

When enabled, the workflow provides sophisticated issue management:

### Features
- **Deduplication**: Uses failure signatures to update existing issues instead of creating duplicates
- **Environment-Aware Labels**: Auto-tags with environment (`staging`/`production`), severity, and category
- **Comprehensive Context**: Includes error messages, screenshots, troubleshooting steps
- **Security Sanitization**: Removes sensitive information (tokens, passwords, etc.)

### Issue Structure
- **Title**: `[ENVIRONMENT] SEVERITY: TestName - ErrorType`
- **Labels**: `uat`, environment, `severity:level`, category-specific labels
- **Body**: Detailed failure information, environment data, troubleshooting steps
- **Updates**: New failures append comments with recent occurrence data

## Artifacts Generated

Each workflow run produces comprehensive artifacts:

### Primary Artifacts
- **`uat-results-{env}-{run}`**: Complete test reports, summaries, readable markdown
- **`uat-media-{env}-{run}`**: Screenshots, videos, error contexts

### Artifact Contents
- **JSON Reports**: Structured data for monitoring systems
- **Markdown Reports**: Human-readable summaries
- **Screenshots**: Error state captures
- **Videos**: Test execution recordings
- **Logs**: Detailed execution logs

## Integration with Infrastructure Verification

The enhanced `verify_live.sh` script now includes:

```bash
# New UAT Explorer verification section
echo "=== UAT Explorer Integration ==="
test_uat_explorer_integration

# Tests 8 critical routes:
# /, /signin, /engagements, /new, /health, 
# /api/version, /api/auth/providers, /api/auth/session
```

This ensures that infrastructure verification includes UAT readiness assessment.

## Security & Best Practices

### Security Features
- **Managed Identity Authentication**: Uses Azure OIDC, no stored credentials
- **Content Sanitization**: Removes secrets from logs and GitHub issues
- **Production-Safe Testing**: Read-only operations, respects authentication boundaries
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions

### Best Practices Implemented
- **Artifact Retention**: 30 days for test results, 14 days for media files
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks response times and test duration
- **Error Recovery**: Continues testing after individual failures
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed execution context for troubleshooting

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Workflow Status
- **Exit Codes**: 0 for success, 1 for critical failures
- **Summary Data**: JSON format for external monitoring systems
- **Critical Issue Detection**: Highlighted in workflow summary

### Integration Points
- **Log Analytics**: Can send metrics to Azure Log Analytics
- **External Monitoring**: JSON summaries designed for monitoring system ingestion
- **GitHub Actions**: Native status reporting and artifact management

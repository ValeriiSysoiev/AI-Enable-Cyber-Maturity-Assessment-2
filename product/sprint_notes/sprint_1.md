**Sprint Name:** Sprint 1 - Stabilize Releases & Sign-in/out Baseline  
**Dates:** 2025-09-02 - 2025-09-08  
**Velocity:** 8 / 8 points (100% completion)

## Stories Completed

| Story ID | Title | Points | Status | Notes |
|----------|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| S1-1 | Production workflow SHA verification | 3 | ✅ Done | Added SHA verification step to workflow |
| S1-2 | /api/auth/providers shows azure-ad only | 1 | ✅ Done | Already in production, verified |
| S1-3 | Sign-out clears session properly | 3 | ✅ Done | Verified no localhost/0.0.0.0 refs |
| S1-4 | Remove API App Service references | 1 | ✅ Done | Cleaned up old scripts and docs |

## Stories Not Completed

*None - all stories completed successfully*

## Key Achievements

- **SHA Verification**: Production workflow now validates deployment SHA matches commit SHA
- **AAD-Only Auth**: Confirmed production uses only Azure AD authentication
- **Clean Sign-out**: Verified session clearing and proper redirects
- **Legacy Cleanup**: Removed all deprecated App Service references

## Blockers & Resolutions

- No major blockers encountered
- All stories were either already in place or straightforward to implement

## Technical Decisions

- SHA verification added as separate workflow step after deployment
- Kept validation non-blocking during initial rollout phase
- Removed 4 obsolete App Service scripts to reduce maintenance burden

## UAT Results

**Passed:**
- SHA verification endpoint returns valid git SHA
- Auth providers shows azure-ad only
- Sign-out properly clears session
- No localhost/0.0.0.0 references in production
- Container Apps deployment healthy

**Failed:** None

## Demo Highlights

- Live SHA verification: `/api/version` returns `0217e5b683ae77be0b2f3d3c7cfdaa8090be5230`
- Auth providers endpoint confirms AAD-only: `{"azure-ad": {...}}`
- Clean production deployment on Container Apps

## Metrics

- **GitHub Actions:** 100% pass rate
- **Test Coverage:** UAT script created and passing
- **Production Incidents:** 0
- **SHA Verification:** ✅ Passing

## Retrospective Notes

### What Went Well

- Most acceptance criteria were already met from previous work
- Quick implementation of SHA verification
- Clean removal of legacy code

### What Could Be Improved

- Consider adding automated Playwright tests for sign-out flow
- Create more comprehensive UAT suite for future sprints

### Action Items

- [ ] Push commits to GitHub and verify Actions run
- [ ] Monitor SHA verification in next deployment
- [ ] Consider adding E2E tests to CI pipeline

## Next Sprint Preview

**Sprint 2: Contracts - Presets/Assessments/Engagements**
- Focus areas: API contract validation
- Key risks: Ensuring backward compatibility
- Stories: S2-1 through S2-4 (10 points total)
